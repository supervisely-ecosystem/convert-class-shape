    <b>Overview:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Result project name = original name + "(new shapes)" suffix</li>
        <li>Your data is safe: app creates new project with modified classes and objects. The original project will
            remain unchanged
        </li>
        <li>If you want to convert AnyShape, you should use another application.</li>
        <li>Note: transformation from raster (bitmap) to vector (polygon) will result in huge number of points.
            App performs approximation to reduce the number. That can lead to slight loss of accuracy at borders.
            Read more in readme. Special settings to control approximation will be released in next versions.
        </li>
    </ul>
